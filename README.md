## What is GODcoin?

GODcoin is the official currency of Christ. There are two types of digital
tokens, gold and silver, which can be exchanged for physical gold and silver.
GODcoin uses proof-of-Stake consensus in a peer-to-peer network for energy
efficiency and security of assets.

For more information see the [whitepaper](https://godcoin.gold/whitepaper).
